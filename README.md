# Steganography: Secure Data Hiding in Images

## Overview
This project implements a steganography technique to securely hide sensitive data within an image. The embedded data remains undetectable to unauthorized users, ensuring both the security and integrity of the hidden information. The system combines image processing with advanced encryption techniques for added protection of the concealed data.

## Features
- **Data Hiding**: Embeds text data within an image without noticeable distortion.
- **Encryption**: Uses encryption to ensure that the hidden data is secure and cannot be easily extracted or tampered with.
- **Decryption**: Allows authorized users to recover the hidden data securely from the image.
- **File Integrity**: Ensures that the image quality is maintained while hiding the data.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the project.
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image manipulation (reading, editing, and saving images).
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Alternative library for image processing.
- **os**: For handling file paths and system-level operations.
- **string**: For manipulating text-based data.
- **base64**: For encoding and decoding binary data within the image.
- **cryptography (optional)**: To provide an extra layer of encryption for hidden data.
- **numpy**: For performing efficient numerical operations on image pixels.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (OpenCV, Pillow, cryptography, numpy, etc.)

Install the necessary libraries by running:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow cryptography numpy
```

### Running the Project

1. **To Hide Data**:  
   Use the script to embed your text data into an image. The data is encrypted and embedded into the image file. Ensure that the image is in a compatible format (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

   Example:
   ```python
   python hide_data.py --image input_image.png --data "This is the hidden message"
   ```

2. **To Extract Data**:  
   Use the script to extract the hidden data from the image. The data will be decrypted and presented to the user.

   Example:
   ```python
   python extract_data.py --image input_image.png
   ```

### Example

#### Hiding Data
- Image: `input_image.png`
- Data to hide: `"Secret message"`

#### Command:
```bash
python hide_data.py --image input_image.png --data "Secret message"
```

The image `input_image.png` will be modified to hide the message, and the output will be saved as `output_image.png`.

#### Extracting Data
To retrieve the hidden message, run the following:

```bash
python extract_data.py --image output_image.png
```

The message `"Secret message"` will be extracted and displayed.

## Future Scope
- Integration of advanced encryption algorithms for stronger security.
- Real-time data hiding in video streams.
- Cross-platform applications for mobile and desktop environments.
- AI-based techniques for detecting and preventing unauthorized data extraction.
